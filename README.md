# tictactoe
You can simply download the ttt.html file, and open it in your browser of choice. It's a Javascript tic tac toe game, nothing less, nothing more. As you'll see, X always goes first, and you can begin by clicking any of the 9 cell buttons to make your move. If someone wins, a message will say so, and all buttons will be frozen. When the game is concluded, you can reset by hitting the green "New Game" button. Have fun!
